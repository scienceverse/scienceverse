<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>(c) Control conditions</head><p><s>Three control conditions were included in this study.</s></p><p><s>(i) To control for any peculiarities of the stimuli that may have caused subjects to trust self morphs more than nonself morphs, another 24 'race'-matched subjects played exactly the same virtual partners in the same sequence of roles as the players in the experimental condition.</s><s>Besides providing a matched control for any idiosyncratic influences, this also controlled for effects of race, as any effects caused solely by the race of the experimental subject should also be seen in the same-race control subject.</s><s>(ii) To assess the possibility that reactions towards self morphs might be mediated by perceptions of differential attractiveness, all stimulus faces were rated on a 10-point Likert scale (anchor adjectives were 1, 'very unattractive' and 10, 'very attractive') by an independent set of 10 undergraduates from the same pool of research volunteers.</s><s>(iii) Finally, to control for the effect of familiarity of self morphs, I repeated the procedure in this experiment using shape-only morphs of famous and non-famous faces in place of self and non-self faces.</s><s>Eight images of famous and non-famous faces were taken from the Internet and chosen to be approximately equal in attractiveness and picture quality.</s><s>These faces served in place of the self and non-self faces, respectively, from the main experiment.</s><s>Each subject played with eight morphs made from one of the same-sex famous faces and eight morphs made from one of the same-sex non-famous faces.</s><s>After the games were played, subjects rated their familiarity with the original (unmorphed) famous and non-famous faces on a fivepoint Likert scale.</s><s>Only subjects who rated the famous faces as familiar (ratings of 4 and 5) and the non-famous faces as unfamiliar (ratings of 1 and 2) were included in the data analyses, although no other criteria for inclusion changed the conclusion.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">DISCUSSION</head><p><s>Experimental subjects, who believed that they were playing against pictured opponents while unaware that information from their own faces had been incorporated into the 'morphed' faces of some of those supposed opponents, trusted opponents who resembled themselves signif icantly more than they trusted other opponents, but did not reward trusting moves by their opponents differentially.</s><s>These results were replicated in two independent groups of subjects, using two distinct facial morphing procedures.</s></p><p><s>These results show that facial resemblance can modulate social behaviour.</s><s>An enhanced positive inclination towards individuals that resemble self was anticipated on the basis of kin selection theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Hamilton 1964)</ref>, but this theory is mute with regard to the mechanisms by which such an inclination is elicited.</s><s>One possibility is that self morphs are perceived as more attractive <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Penton-Voak et al. 1999</ref>) by the subjects and that more attractive people are trusted more.</s><s>However, analysis of the subjects' game choices in relation to the independent ratings of the attractiveness of the stimulus faces does not support this Proc.</s><s>R. <ref type="bibr">Soc. Lond. B (2002)</ref> possibility, as no effect of attractiveness on either trusting or self ishness was seen, even for non-self morphs.</s></p><p><s>The absence of an effect of familiarity using famous faces indicates that the relevant cue(s) modulating discriminative trusting moves may be more than simply familiarity.</s><s>However, this is only weak evidence against familiarity as a mediator of the effect of resemblance on trusting behaviour, as the familiarity that one can gain through television and movies may be insuff icient or of a different quality from that gained through personal experience.</s></p><p><s>The fact that self morphs were treated preferentially by subjects playing P1 but not by the same subjects playing P2 may be explicable in terms of the different pay-off structures in the two-person bargaining game.</s><s>Following the logic of inclusive fitness theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Hamilton 1964)</ref>, P1 is expected to be indifferent between trusting and not trusting if the coeff icient of relatedness between the players is zero (r = 0) and P2's probability of a self ish betrayal of trust is equal to the probability of reciprocating trust (that is, if p = 0.5 for both moves), because the expected pay-off is the same in each case.</s><s>Any increase in the probability of P2 reciprocating trust or in the utility that P1 derives from P2's pay-offs as a result of kinship cues would then raise P1's expected pay-off from trusting above that from not trusting.</s><s>However, P2's expected utility from the results of an unself ish decision will exceed that from a self ish decision only if r Ï¾ 0.5 (the equivalent of full siblings).</s><s>Clearly, subjects did not behave in full accordance with such a model, because it cannot explain why they sometimes rewarded the trust of non-self morphs with unself ish responses.</s><s>However, in conjunction with the additional considerations needed to explain why nonnepotistic generosity ever occurs, this asymmetry may help to explain why resemblance affected only the subjects' initial gestures of trust and not the reciprocation of trust by their opponents.</s></p><p><s>If humans are indeed using phenotype matching to make decisions about social behaviour, several interesting questions are raised.</s><s>Foremost is whether humans use the self or others as a referent.</s><s>Our human ancestors did not have mirrors until relatively recently and reflections in water would provide quite degraded information.</s><s>Using a genetically encoded template of what one's face looks like seems highly implausible.</s><s>Hence, the most likely mechanism for phenotype matching is expected to depend on familial referents.</s><s>The weakness in relying on facial resemblance of an unknown person to that of a relative identified as such by association or family history, such as mother and maternal siblings, is that this mechanism would not provide reliable information about paternal relatives nor allow one to differentiate full siblings from half siblings.</s></p><p><s>It would be interesting to replicate the present study using 'genetic' siblings and adopted unrelated siblings.</s><s>If people use self-referential phenotype matching, self morphs made from adopted and non-adopted subjects should elicit similar effects on trusting behaviour.</s><s>If subjects are shown morphs made from their genetic or adopted siblings, the effect on trust should be completely absent or only present for morphs made from genetic siblings, inasmuch as they resemble the subject.</s><s>However, if humans instead use other kin as referents, the data should exhibit the opposite pattern.</s><s>Self morphs should elicit little effect on trust for adopted subjects, but morphs made from both genetic and adopted siblings should elicit at least as large an effect as self-morphs do for non-adopted subjects.</s><s>Of course, both types of phenotype matching could occur at the same time, as has been shown to be the case in Belding's ground squirrels <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Holmes &amp;
