<abstract xml:lang="en"><p align="left"><bold><italic>Objective:</italic></bold> Previous work has examined family income and material hardship in pediatric cancer. However, few studies have focused on perceived financial strain (PFS), or the extent to which caregivers perceive financial stress and worry related to their child&#8217;s cancer.

<sec id="s1"><p align="left">Financial hardship is common among families of children with cancer and is associated with numerous negative downstream effects on the family (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr34-1" rid="c34">Pelletier &amp; Bona, 2015</xref>). In adult oncology, and more recently in pediatric oncology, the existence of such negative effects of cancer-related financial burden has been termed &#8220;financial toxicity&#8221; (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr12-1" rid="c12">de Souza et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr11-1" rid="c11">de Souza &amp; Conti, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr38-1" rid="c38">Santacroce &amp; Kneipp, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr39-1" rid="c39">Santacroce et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr54-1" rid="c54">Zafar &amp; Abernethy, 2013</xref>). Financial toxicity can be defined as the combined impact on a family of objective material burden and subjective financial distress (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr9-1" rid="c9">Carrera et al., 2018</xref>). Evidence to date suggests that financial toxicity within the pediatric cancer population is widespread, prompting researchers to call for standardized assessment of financial burden in pediatric cancer care models (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr34-2" rid="c34">Pelletier &amp; Bona, 2015</xref>). However, gaps in current understanding of the trajectory of perceived financial strain (PFS), the subjective distress and worry about finances, across the course of treatment and its specific effects on the psychological well-being of family members limit current ability to develop appropriately timed and targeted interventions (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr34-3" rid="c34">Pelletier &amp; Bona, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr39-2" rid="c39">Santacroce et al., 2018</xref>). The current study aims to address these gaps by describing the longitudinal trajectory of caregiver PFS during the first year of treatment, understanding predictors of this trajectory, and examining associations between the financial strain trajectory and psychological adjustment of primary caregivers and patients.</p>
<sec id="s3" disp-level="subsect1">
<title>Financial Strain and Pediatric Cancer</title><p align="left">Cancer-related financial hardship is commonly reported during treatment due to both direct and indirect costs of treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr14-1" rid="c14">Eiser &amp; Upton, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr27-1" rid="c27">Limburg et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr49-1" rid="c49">Wakefield et al., 2014</xref>). Families report experiencing household material hardship due to cancer-related costs. For example, 30% of families of children on chemotherapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr7-1" rid="c7">Bona et al., 2016</xref>) and 38% of families of children receiving stem cell transplants (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr6-1" rid="c6">Bona et al., 2015</xref>) endorsed food, energy, and housing insecurity. Reviews of the literature have identified two major sources of hardship: out-of-pocket expenses and income lost due to work disruptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr34-4" rid="c34">Pelletier &amp; Bona, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr39-3" rid="c39">Santacroce et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr48-1" rid="c48">Tsimicalis et al., 2011</xref>). Out-of-pocket expenses are common during treatment and include travel for treatment, accommodations, and childcare (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr31-1" rid="c31">Miedema et al., 2008</xref>). Most families additionally encounter income losses following employment disruptions due to cancer, as one caregiver commonly stops working or reduces work hours to care for the child with cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr5-1" rid="c5">Bona et al., 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr7-2" rid="c7">2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr31-2" rid="c31">Miedema et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr50-1" rid="c50">Warner et al., 2015</xref>). In one study, 77%&#8211;94% of parents reported work disruptions and 30%&#8211;50% of families reported that one parent stopped working to provide care after a pediatric cancer diagnosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr13-1" rid="c13">Dussel et al., 2011</xref>).</p>

<title>Predictors of Financial Strain</title><p align="left">Several sociodemographic factors have been identified that confer greater risk for financial hardship and its sequelae. Lower income, single-parent status, longer and more intense treatment protocols, need to travel for treatment, other children in the home, younger child age, and younger parent age have been identified as significant risk factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr5-2" rid="c5">Bona et al., 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr6-2" rid="c6">2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr23-1" rid="c23">Klassen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr30-1" rid="c30">Mader et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr32-1" rid="c32">Pagano et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr34-5" rid="c34">Pelletier &amp; Bona, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr39-4" rid="c39">Santacroce et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr40-1" rid="c40">Santos et al., 2016</xref>). Of these, lower income appears to robustly affect risk for financial hardship (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr6-3" rid="c6">Bona et al., 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr7-3" rid="c7">2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr34-6" rid="c34">Pelletier &amp; Bona, 2015</xref>). In two recent studies, low-income families suffered disproportionate income loss compared to their higher income counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr6-4" rid="c6">Bona et al., 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr7-4" rid="c7">2016</xref>). Specifically, among families of children undergoing chemotherapy, low-income families reported losing 49% of annual household income at six months postdiagnosis, compared to a loss of 6% reported by higher-income families (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr7-5" rid="c7">Bona et al., 2016</xref>). Furthermore, income level may also be closely related to single-caregiver status. Previous work has shown that single caregivers experience difficulty balancing the demands of work and maintaining income as the sole provider with the demands of providing cancer care to their children (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr19-1" rid="c19">Granek et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, income and relationship status, among other sociodemographic factors, are critical to examine in association with financial strain.</p>

<title>Psychosocial Impact of Financial Strain</title><p align="left">Financial hardship during pediatric cancer has downstream effects on family well-being. PFS has been associated with family relationship problems, including poor marital adjustment and higher sibling conflict (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr17-1" rid="c17">Fladeboe et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr25-1" rid="c25">Lavi et al., 2018</xref>), and parents note finances as a major source of stress and worry during treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr33-1" rid="c33">Patterson et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr44-1" rid="c44">Sloper, 1996</xref>). Cancer-related material financial burden has also been associated with psychological maladjustment among caregivers, including depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr10-1" rid="c10">Creswell et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr36-1" rid="c36">Rosenberg et al., 2013</xref>). Families with lower income typically experience more distress than families with higher income (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr4-1" rid="c4">Bemis et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr8-1" rid="c8">Canning et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr10-2" rid="c10">Creswell et al., 2014</xref>). In one study, unemployment in adolescent and young adult survivors of pediatric cancer ages 14&#8211;39 was related to higher distress (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr24-1" rid="c24">Kwak et al., 2013</xref>). However, no work has examined effects of financial strain on the well-being of children with cancer while in treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr34-7" rid="c34">Pelletier &amp; Bona, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr39-5" rid="c39">Santacroce et al., 2018</xref>). Furthermore, no studies have investigated the impact of PFS on the trajectory of child adjustment over the course of pediatric cancer treatment. It is important to understand the effect of PFS on the trajectory of child adjustment to develop family-centered interventions that target those family members who are most affected by financial hardship, as well as intervene in a timely manner.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s6" disp-level="subsect1">
<title>Perceived Financial Strain and Current Study</title><p align="left">Most studies to date have assessed financial hardship by measuring families&#8217; out-of-pocket expenses, amount of income lost, and material hardship. While these methods objectively measure the extent to which cancer affects families&#8217; financial well-being, they do not capture individual differences in caregivers&#8217; appraisals of financial stress, or how much stress they subjectively experience due to financial issues. PFS reflects a parent&#8217;s sense of economic distress and the perceived gap between needs and available resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr3-1" rid="c3">Barrera et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr9-2" rid="c9">Carrera et al., 2018</xref>). Given that families report distress about the expenses of cancer care and managing finances (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr9-3" rid="c9">Carrera et al., 2018</xref>), it is important to examine PFS. Although income is a critical factor to consider as families manage the financial demands of the cancer experience, it is also important to assess caregivers&#8217; subjective experience of financial strain as a predictor of family adjustment. A parent&#8217;s subjective perception of their financial situation may have a relevant impact on family adjustment, above and beyond that of income.</p>
<p align="left">Little is understood about the trajectory of PFS over the course of treatment. Of the few studies assessing material and perceived financial hardship long-term, most have concluded that hardship persists through treatment and survivorship (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr7-6" rid="c7">Bona et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr31-3" rid="c31">Miedema et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr33-2" rid="c33">Patterson et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr34-8" rid="c34">Pelletier &amp; Bona, 2015</xref>). However, timing of assessments relative to diagnosis has varied substantially, and few studies have used more than two time points, limiting the ability to describe this trajectory with specificity. To our knowledge there are no longitudinal studies that have examined the subjective appraisal of financial strain throughout pediatric cancer treatment, so the trajectory of PFS is unknown. One possibility is that PFS persists and remains stable; as material hardship persists, subjective stress about finances will continue. A second possibility is that PFS may increase throughout treatment, as medical costs accumulate over time and parents experience cumulative financial stress. A third possibility is that PFS decreases over time if parents adjust to and cope with financial burdens. Understanding the typical course of financial stress and the predictors of that course over time may be useful in informing the timing of intervention or preventative efforts.</p>
<p align="left">Finally, it is critical to understand how between-family and within-family differences in financial strain are predictive of trajectories of family adjustment over the first year of pediatric cancer treatment. Previous work has demonstrated that families with higher financial strain relative to other families have poorer psychological adjustment (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr8-2" rid="c8">Canning et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr10-3" rid="c10">Creswell et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr36-2" rid="c36">Rosenberg et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr45-1" rid="c45">Stuber et al., 2010</xref>). However, adjustment may vary over time as families experience more or less financial strain at different points in the treatment process, relative to their own average burden. Understanding within-person variance in strain at different timepoints is important to inform how often providers should assess financial strain to best identify families at higher risk for poor psychological adjustment.</p>
<p align="left">The current study has three aims: (1) to describe the trajectory of primary caregiver PFS assessed at each month across the first year of treatment; (2) to examine sociodemographic predictors of the trajectory of primary caregiver PFS; and (3) to understand associations between PFS and trajectories of caregiver and child psychosocial adjustment over time. Given limited evidence regarding how PFS may vary over the course of treatment, we do not propose a specific hypothesis regarding the trajectory of caregiver PFS over time. Based on prior studies, we hypothesize that that lower caregiver income will be significantly associated with higher average levels of PFS across the first year of pediatric cancer treatment above and beyond other sociodemographic predictors, and that PFS across the first year of cancer treatment will be associated with the trajectory of psychosocial functioning in both caregivers and patients. Specifically, we predict that lower PFS will be associated with better caregiver and child adjustment and a more rapid decline in psychological distress over the course of treatment.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="s8" disp-level="subsect1">
<title>Participants</title><p align="left">Families of children recently diagnosed with cancer were recruited from two hospitals in urban areas in the northwest and southeast United States. Families were eligible to participate if the child had no history of a developmental delay and spoke English, and if the current primary caregiver was the same as prior to the cancer diagnosis. Families were excluded if the child had neurofibromatosis type I (NF1), relapsed cancer, or secondary malignancy. Caregivers self-identified the child&#8217;s primary caregiver to participate in the study.</p>

<title>Procedures</title><p align="left">The current study was part of a larger project investigating longitudinal family adjustment to pediatric cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr21-1" rid="c21">Katz et al., 2018</xref>). Families of children newly diagnosed with cancer were initially approached by their physician or nurse within two weeks of diagnosis. Families who were interested in participating in the study were then approached by a member of the research team who obtained consent and HIPAA authorization. Informed consent was obtained from primary caregivers at the time of enrollment.</p>
<p align="left">Primary caregivers completed questionnaires of sociodemographic characteristics, PFS, child adjustment, and their own psychological adjustment monthly over a 12-month period. If a completed questionnaire packet was not received by the study team within two weeks of mailing, the packet was skipped and the next month&#8217;s packet was sent. Participants were compensated for their participation. IRB approval was received from the University of Washington, Seattle Children&#8217;s Hospital, and Vanderbilt University for all study procedures.</p>

<title>Caregiver Anxiety</title><p align="left">Anxiety symptoms were measured using the anxiety subscale of the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr29-1" rid="c29">Lovibond &amp; Lovibond, 1995</xref>). This 7-item subscale assesses parent-reported frequency of anxiety symptoms in the past month. Items were summed to create total scores ranging from 0 to 21, with higher scores indicating more frequent anxiety symptoms. Cronbach&#8217;s alpha in the current sample ranged from .73 to .88, with an average of .84 across the 12 time points.</p>

<title>Caregiver Post-Traumatic Stress Symptoms</title><p align="left">PTSS were measured using the Impact of Events Scale&#8212;Revised (IES-R; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr51-1" rid="c51">Weiss &amp; Marmar, 1997</xref>). This is a 22-item self-report measure with three subscales of PTSS: (1) Avoidance, (2) Intrusion, (3) and Hyperarousal. A total PTSS score was calculated by summing the average score of each subscale. Total scores may range from 0 to 12, with higher scores indicating more PTSS. Reliability was high in our sample, with Cronbach&#8217;s alpha ranging from .92 to .95, with an average of .94 across the 12 time points.</p>

<title>Child Internalizing and Externalizing Symptoms</title><p align="left">Children&#8217;s psychological adjustment was measured using the parent-report versions of the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr1-1" rid="c1">Achenbach, 1991</xref>); specifically, <italic>T-</italic>scores for externalizing symptoms and internalizing symptoms were analyzed. Caregivers of children who were 2 to 5 years old completed the preschool form, and caregivers of children who were 6 to 18 years old completed the school-age form. The CBCL assesses numerous domains of children&#8217;s psychosocial functioning, including a variety of internalizing symptoms (anxious/depressed symptoms, withdrawn/depressed symptoms, somatic complaints) and externalizing symptoms (rule-breaking behavior, aggressive behavior). Previous work has demonstrated that the somatic complaints score may not be as valid in parent report of chronically ill populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr35-1" rid="c35">Perrin et al., 1991</xref>), thus only the anxious/depressed score was used to assess internalizing symptoms.</p>

<title>Data Analytic Strategy</title><p align="left">Because of the nested within-participant structure of the data, we analyzed data using a multilevel modeling (MLM) approach using the maximum likelihood estimator in R to model the trajectory of financial strain over time, examine sociodemographic predictors of that trajectory, and test association between the trajectory of financial strain and caregiver and child adjustment outcomes. Missing data were handled in MLM with fill-information maximum likelihood, which allows family trajectories to be estimated from a different number of observations for each caregiver (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr15-1" rid="c15">Enders, 2010</xref>). Caregivers&#8217; data were included in the model if they had any follow-up data after the first timepoint.</p>
<sec id="s18" disp-level="subsect2">
<title>Modeling the Trajectory of PFS</title><p align="left">A linear growth model was estimated to model the average trajectory of caregiver financial strain and variability in that trajectory between caregivers. Time was coded from 0 (baseline) to 11 (12 months), with each code representing the month in which data was received. This model estimated two fixed effects: an intercept parameter representing the starting point of PFS, as well as a slope parameter representing the rate of linear change in PFS over time. We also tested whether estimating random effects for the intercept and slope improved model fit to determine whether there were between-person differences in initial levels or rate of change over time in financial strain, and we found that inclusion of random effects of intercept and slope improved model fit (see <xref ref-type="table" id="tbc1-1" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>).<xref ref-type="table-anchor" rid="tbl1"/></p>

<sec id="s19" disp-level="subsect2">
<title>Examining Sociodemographic Predictors of PFS</title><p align="left">Next, we examined whether each sociodemographic predictor was independently associated with the level of (intercept) or rate of change in (slope) PFS. Child diagnosis was categorized into three groups (leukemia/lymphoma, CNS tumors, and non-CNS tumors) and dummy coded with the leukemia/lymphoma group as the reference group.</p>

<sec id="s20" disp-level="subsect2">
<title>Examining Associations Between Financial Strain and Adjustment Outcomes</title><p align="left">We first modeled the average trajectory and variability of each caregiver and child adjustment outcome using similar methods as described to model the trajectory of PFS. For these models, time was coded from &#8211;11 (baseline) to 0 (12 months). Thus, the intercept parameter represented the end point for each outcome (12 months postdiagnosis). Next, to test whether financial strain was associated with differences in caregiver and child outcomes over time, we followed the recommendations of <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr16-1" rid="c16">Enders and Tofighi (2007)</xref> to center PFS at within- and between-person levels (Level 1 and Level 2, respectively). The within-person level represents differences in PFS month to month within an individual, and the between-person level represents differences in PFS relative to other caregivers. To obtain within-person predictors, we extracted residual values of PFS at each month from a model of the trajectory of PFS over time, which allowed us to control for individual differences in levels and change over time in PFS. The within-person score reflects the deviation between an individual&#8217;s observed and predicted PFS score in a given month (i.e., deviation from their own model-estimated PFS trajectory). Its effect on the outcome (i.e., psychological adjustment) tests whether this deviation is associated with concurrent differences in adjustment. To obtain between-person predictors, each caregiver&#8217;s mean predicted PFS was then subtracted from the estimated grand mean, or the average PFS across all observations for all caregivers. The between-person score reflects how much each caregiver&#8217;s predicted average PFS over time deviated from the sample average, and its effects on each outcome reflects how this deviation was associated with differences in trajectories of adjustment over time. Finally, in each of these models we included family income as a covariate to determine if PFS is uniquely associated with caregiver and child adjustment above and beyond income.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<sec id="s22" disp-level="subsect1">
<title>Sample Characteristics</title><p align="left">Five hundred and two families met eligibility criteria, and 309 were approached for participation. One hundred and seventy-six families were enrolled in the study, and 159 families completed at least one study component. Those who were approached but did not enroll in the study refused participation either because it required too much time, or did not give a reason. The current study included 159 families. The children were 52% female, with a mean age of 6.31 (<italic>SD</italic> = 3.54) years. Pediatric cancer diagnoses of the sample were 36% leukemia, 23% non-CNS tumors, 22% CNS tumors, 11% lymphoma, and 8% other cancers. Primary caregivers were identified by the families as 86% mothers, 11% fathers, and 3% other (i.e., grandparents, step-parents). Caregivers were on average 36.45 (<italic>SD</italic> = 7.98) years old, and the sample was 89% White/Caucasian, 5% Black/African American, 3% Asian, 3% other. Seventy-eight percent of caregivers reported they were married. The median annual income of the sample was $60,000&#8211;$69,000, with over 25% of the sample earning $100,000 or more per year.</p>

<sec id="s23" disp-level="subsect1">
<title>Missing Data</title><p align="left">There were on average 80 respondents at each timepoint of assessment. Missingness analyses demonstrated that completion rate of the PFS measure (i.e., number of completed time points) was not correlated with baseline reports of PFS, any sociodemographic variables, or child adjustment. There were small, negative correlations between completion rates of the PFS measure and average caregiver depression (<italic>r</italic> = &#8211;.19, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05), anxiety (<italic>r</italic> = &#8211;.23, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01), and PTSS (<italic>r</italic> = &#8211;.21, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05), suggesting that more distressed caregivers were less likely to complete measures.</p>

<sec id="s24" disp-level="subsect1">
<title>Summary of PFS Trajectory Over Time</title><p align="left">On average, caregiver financial strain was 19.41 units at baseline, and financial strain decreased by .17 units every month over the first year of treatment (see <xref ref-type="table" id="tbc1-2" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Sufficient variance was observed in both the intercept and slope to test predictors of these differences. Specifically, random effects suggested that for 68% of families, baseline levels of financial strain ranged between 13.35 and 25.47 units, and rates of changed ranged between &#8211;.63 and .29 over time. Thus, while on average caregivers experienced gradual declines in financial strain, some experienced steeper declines and some sustained or increased in PFS over time.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s25" disp-level="subsect1">
<title>Sociodemographic Predictors of Trajectory of PFS</title><p align="left">Of the eight sociodemographic predictors examined, income and marital status were significantly associated with level of PFS (see <xref ref-type="table" id="tbc1-3" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). Caregiver race, caregiver age, child age, child diagnosis, intensity of treatment, and number of children in the family were not significantly associated with level of PFS, and they did not explain any additional variance in PFS. Lower income was associated with higher levels of financial strain (<italic>b</italic> = &#8211;.82, <italic>SE</italic> = .15, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001); thus, caregivers with an annual income of $40,000 would report PFS 4.1 units higher at each time point than a caregiver with an annual income of $100,000. Marital status was also associated with levels of financial strain (<italic>b</italic> = &#8211;4.31, <italic>SE</italic> = 1.23, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), such that caregivers who were nonmarried reported PFS 4.3 units higher at each time point compared to married caregivers. Marital status was also associated with the rate of change in financial strain, such that PFS decreased at a faster rate over time for married caregivers compared to nonmarried caregivers (<italic>b</italic> = &#8211;.29, <italic>SE</italic> = .11, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01).</p>

<title>Trajectories of Caregiver and Child Adjustment</title><p align="left">Prior to examining the association between PFS and caregiver and child adjustment outcomes, we modeled the trajectory for each individual adjustment outcome (caregiver depression, anxiety, PTSS, child internalizing symptoms, and child externalizing symptoms). Linear growth models for each adjustment outcome followed a similar trend, such that there was a decline in symptoms over time and variability in trajectories (see <xref ref-type="table" id="tbc2-1" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>).<xref ref-type="table-anchor" rid="tbl2"/></p>

<sec id="s27" disp-level="subsect1">
<title>PFS and Caregiver Adjustment</title><p align="left">At the between-person level, PFS was associated with level of caregiver depression across the first year of pediatric cancer treatment (<italic>b</italic> = .38, <italic>SE</italic> = .10, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) controlling for family income (see <xref ref-type="table" id="tbc2-2" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). Specifically, caregivers who reported higher average PFS relative to other caregivers tended to have higher levels of depression through the first year of treatment. PFS was also associated with caregiver depression at the within-person level (<italic>b</italic> = .36, <italic>SE</italic> = .11, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). In a given month, when caregivers reported a one-unit increase in PFS relative to their trajectory across treatment, they also tended to report a concurrent .36 unit increase in depressive symptoms. We found significant interaction effects, such that at the between-person level PFS was associated with differences in rates of change in caregiver depression over time (<italic>b</italic> = .02, <italic>SE</italic> = .01, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05), which suggested that depressive symptoms decreased less for caregivers higher on average PFS.</p>
<p align="left">At the between-person level, PFS was associated with caregiver anxiety over time (<italic>b</italic> = .16, <italic>SE</italic> = .06, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) controlling for family income. Specifically, caregivers who reported higher average PFS relative to other caregivers tended to have higher levels of anxiety over time. PFS was not associated with caregiver anxiety at the within-person level.</p>
<p align="left">At the between-person level, PFS was not associated with levels of caregiver PTSS over time. However, PFS was associated with caregiver PTSS (<italic>b</italic> = .52, <italic>SE</italic> = .24, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05) at the within-person level controlling for family income. Specifically, in a given month when caregivers reported a one-unit increase in PFS compared to their average trajectory, they tended to report a concurrent .52 unit increase in PTSS symptoms. An interaction between the between- and within-persons effects of PFS was associated with levels of PTSS (<italic>b</italic> = &#8211;.07, <italic>SE</italic> = .02, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). Specifically, this effect suggests that monthly fluctuations in a caregiver&#8217;s level of PFS have a smaller effect on their concurrent level of PTSS when their average PFS over time is high relative to others.</p>

<title>Discussion</title><p align="left">Our results align with previous research suggesting that nonmarried and lower income caregivers are at a greater risk for financial hardship (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr6-5" rid="c6">Bona et al., 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr7-7" rid="c7">2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr34-9" rid="c34">Pelletier &amp; Bona, 2015</xref>), and extend these findings by suggesting that these differences are also evident in subjective financial strain. Caregivers who are not married and/or have lower income are not only at increased risk for objective hardship but also for PFS. However, compared to research done on sociodemographic predictors of objective hardship, fewer predictors were associated with PFS. This may be due to limited variability in the sociodemographics of the participants in the current sample or because they differ from previous studies. In the current study, treatment intensity was rated on a scale of 1&#8211;4, but 87.4% of the sample had a rating of either 2 or 3. It may be that treatment intensity is associated with PFS particularly for those who have either very high or very low treatment intensity and our sample did not fully capture the full range of treatment intensity. That our results differ from previous studies on objective economic strain suggests that PFS is a unique construct, thus both should be assessed. Further research should examine the differential sociodemographic predictors of PFS versus objective hardship.</p>
<p align="left">PFS may be lower in caregivers who are married compared to those who are not married, as spouses may continue to work and provide income as well as emotional support, thus reducing the perceived financial burden on primary caregivers. Previous work has demonstrated that lower income, nonmarried caregivers are also at greater risk for poor adjustment (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr4-2" rid="c4">Bemis et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr8-3" rid="c8">Canning et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr10-4" rid="c10">Creswell et al., 2014</xref>), suggesting that lower-income and/or nonmarried caregivers may benefit most from financial assistance and psychosocial support to manage financial worries. Providers should inform caregivers at risk for higher PFS of charitable organizations (e.g., Ronald McDonald House) and government policies such as the Family and Medical Leave Act through which they can take paid time off from work to care for their ill child (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr53-1" rid="c53">Wiener et al., 2020</xref>), and should assist families with accessing these support services.</p>
<p align="left">The trajectory of PFS on average declined over the first year of treatment. However, there was variability between caregivers, and PFS remained high for some. Previous work illustrates that financial hardship may continue beyond cancer treatment and families struggle to manage medical costs long-term (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr13-2" rid="c13">Dussel et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr31-4" rid="c31">Miedema et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr34-10" rid="c34">Pelletier &amp; Bona, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr49-2" rid="c49">Wakefield et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, future work should investigate risk factors that predict persistently high PFS for families, and health care teams should assess caregiver PFS throughout the cancer experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr53-2" rid="c53">Wiener et al., 2020</xref>).</p>
<p align="left">PFS was associated with trajectories of caregiver psychological adjustment. Consistent with previous reports using objective measures of financial hardship (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr10-5" rid="c10">Creswell et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr36-3" rid="c36">Rosenberg et al., 2013</xref>), the current study found that caregivers with higher PFS experienced higher levels of depression and anxiety symptoms over time, and monthly increases in PFS were associated with concurrent increases in depression and PTSS. Although income and PFS were moderately associated in the current sample, PFS accounted for unique variance beyond income, suggesting that caregivers&#8217; subjective appraisals of financial strain, including perceived changes in and worries about finances, are uniquely associated with distress regardless of income level. While previous research has demonstrated that lower income and material burden are associated with a higher risk for poor adjustment (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr4-3" rid="c4">Bemis et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr8-4" rid="c8">Canning et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr10-6" rid="c10">Creswell et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr45-2" rid="c45">Stuber et al., 2010</xref>), our findings suggest that experiencing high PFS also poses a unique, additive risk.</p>
<p align="left">Taken together, these findings suggest that assessing caregiver&#8217;s subjective appraisal and distress around finances may help identify at-risk caregivers. Caregivers may benefit from psychosocial programs focused on managing stress and financial worries or instrumental support managing finances. For example, one study piloted a financial counseling intervention with adults with cancer focused on financial education, budgeting, managing health insurance, and financial coaching and found that PFS decreased from pre- to postintervention (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr43-1" rid="c43">Shankaran et al., 2018</xref>). Caregivers may benefit from such programs that help reduce psychological distress. Other work has found benefits associated with teaching caregivers stress management and coping skills to reduce financial worries (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr34-11" rid="c34">Pelletier &amp; Bona, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr36-4" rid="c36">Rosenberg et al., 2013</xref>). Programs designed to assess and address issues around both material hardship and finance-related distress may be most effective at mitigating downstream effects on caregiver and family well-being.</p>
<p align="left">Interestingly, PFS was not associated with trajectories of child adjustment at either the within- or between-families level, suggesting that caregiver PFS may not have a direct impact on child well-being. In contrast, income was significantly associated with child externalizing symptoms, suggesting that the various hardships associated with lower income may be a more important factor related to children&#8217;s well-being, while perceived stress around money may be more impactful on parents. The younger average age of children in this sample may also be a critical factor to consider. Although the current sample did not include a large enough cohort of adolescents to test age-related differences, it is possible that younger children may have limited awareness of family finances while adolescents may notice their parents&#8217; financial concerns more acutely and are thus more affected. Indeed, some research has demonstrated that adolescent and young adult survivors of childhood cancer experience financial toxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr46-1" rid="c46">Thom et al., 2018</xref>). Additional explanations for the lack of association between PFS and child adjustment are that PFS has a delayed effect on children, meaning that children may not experience effects of PFS unless this hardship is sustained over time, or that PFS may only affect child well-being indirectly, such as through caregiver adjustment or family conflict. Further research is needed to elucidate these pathways. Given that siblings of children with cancer are at risk for poor psychosocial adjustment (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr28-1" rid="c28">Long &amp; Marsland, 2011</xref>), future research should also investigate effects of PFS on sibling outcomes.</p>
<p align="left">There are several limitations to the current study. Participants in our sample were primarily White caregivers with relatively high incomes and education levels, thus limiting generalizability of the findings. The sample was also limited to English-speaking participants, as the measure of PFS was not validated in other languages. Non-English-speaking families are more likely to have lower income, less likely to be insured, and have significantly longer hospital stays (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr18-1" rid="c18">Flores &amp; Tomany-Korman, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr26-1" rid="c26">Levas et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr41-1" rid="c41">Scheurer et al., 2018</xref>); thus, they are at risk of higher medical costs and greater financial burden. It is critical to investigate PFS, psychological adjustment, and the particular needs of non-English speaking families. Additionally, given the higher income and education of our sample, the findings may not replicate in lower income samples, as income may account for more variance in PFS or family adjustment when income is very low.</p>
<p align="left">There are several limitations related to scope of data collected in this study. First, sociodemographic variables were only collected at baseline; thus, our findings do not capture whether change in these variables (e.g., income) affects PFS. Second, we did not collect data on some factors that may influence PFS (e.g., length of treatment, distance traveled for treatment; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr32-2" rid="c32">Pagano et al., 2014</xref>), limiting our ability to comprehensively understand which families may encounter worse PFS over time. Additional work should consider other sociodemographic factors and stressful life events as potential predictors of PFS (e.g., insurance status, changes in caregiver employment, financial support from other family members, changes in caregiver marital status; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr52-1" rid="c52">Wiener et al., 2015</xref>). Furthermore, repeated and ongoing assessment of these factors is critical to assessing their impact on PFS throughout treatment, survivorship, and bereavement. Third, our measure of PFS (adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr3-3" rid="c3">Barrera et al., 2001</xref>) does not have norms, so we cannot compare the levels of PFS in this sample to the general population. As we did not assess material financial hardship, we also could not determine the extent to which PFS and material hardship are related or uniquely contribute to adjustment.</p>
<p align="left">Finally, there is some potential for bias in the current study. First, as all measures were completed by primary caregivers, single-reporter bias may be a concern. Caregivers who experienced greater psychological distress may have also been more likely to appraise their financial situation poorly or experience more subjective strain associated with finances. Second, attrition may have introduced bias into our analyses. Caregivers with poorer baseline psychological adjustment tended to have more missing data, suggesting that our results may underestimate degree of PFS and caregiver psychological adjustment; in addition, other unassessed factors may have influenced both participation rates and outcomes of interest.</p>
<p align="left">There are multiple implications for future research and care. The current study provides evidence for the importance of assessing caregiver PFS. However, previous work has indicated that health care providers may lack awareness of the full depth of families&#8217; financial distress, seemingly making it more difficult for caregivers to feel comfortable discussing their financial burdens and receiving assistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr34-12" rid="c34">Pelletier &amp; Bona, 2015</xref>). It is critical to educate health care teams about the scope of PFS, so that they understand the impact of financial strain and are better equipped to assess for distress and offer emotional support and resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr20-1" rid="c20">Jones et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr53-3" rid="c53">Wiener et al., 2020</xref>). It is also important for future work to investigate the impact of PFS specifically on fathers. Fathers are more likely than mothers to maintain employment (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr30-2" rid="c30">Mader et al., 2016</xref>), and they report conflict between caring for their child with cancer and working to provide income to cover medical costs (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr37-1" rid="c37">Santacroce et al., 2020</xref>). Additional research is needed to understand PFS among fathers and secondary caregivers.</p>
<p align="left">The Standards for psychosocial care of children with cancer and their families recommend that health care providers assess for financial strain and provide various services to support families&#8217; objective financial burden and PFS (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr52-2" rid="c52">Wiener et al., 2015</xref>). However, recent work demonstrates that there are many barriers to implementing these standards, including lack of adequate providers to offer psychosocial care and inconsistent level of care (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr20-2" rid="c20">Jones et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr42-1" rid="c42">Scialla et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr53-4" rid="c53">Wiener et al., 2020</xref>). The current study presents additional evidence of the importance of assessing financial burden and PFS over time and offering families both material and emotional support around managing finances. The recently published Matrix and Guidelines to the Standards of psychosocial care provide specific recommendations to implement care consistent with the standard of assessing financial hardship (<xref ref-type="bibr" id="cr53-5" rid="c53">Wiener et al., 2020</xref>).</p>
<p align="left">This study contributes to the growing body of evidence demonstrating that financial toxicity is a major concern in families of children with cancer. With a novel focus on PFS in caregivers during pediatric cancer treatment, these data suggest that parents experience changes in PFS over the course of treatment, that nonmarried and lower income caregivers may be at highest risk, and that PFS uniquely contributes to caregiver psychological adjustment regardless of income level. A critical next step is to develop and disseminate programs aimed at mitigating financial toxicity by offering instrumental and psychological support for caregivers experiencing financial-related distress. Supporting caregivers as they navigate the substantial financial burden as well as myriad other stressors associated with pediatric cancer should be a top priority in psychosocial oncology care, with the potential for major concurrent and downstream benefits for caregiver and family well-being.</p>
