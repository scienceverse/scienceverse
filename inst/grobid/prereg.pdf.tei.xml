<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Are One-tailed Tests and Sequential Analyses Appropriate in Psychology?</head><p><s>The discussion about whether one-tailed tests should be used in psychology has started more than 60 years ago <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Burke, 1953;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Eysenck, 1960;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Goldfried, 1959;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Jones, 1952</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Jones, , 1954;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Kimmel, 1957;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Marks, 1953)</ref>, and remains a topic of debate until today.</s><s>It seems likely that the researchers who choose to dedicate their time to publish on this topic are those that have the most extreme opinions, but relatively little is known about the average researcher's attitudes towards one-tailed tests.</s><s>We can see one-tailed tests are rarely used in psychology, maybe because researchers prefer to avoid this discussion during the review process.</s><s>In medicine, one-tailed tests are used more commonly, especially in large randomized controlled Phase III trials.</s><s><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Greenland, Senn, Rothman, Carlin, Poole, Goodman, and Altman (2016)</ref> respond to the statement that "One should always use two-sided p-values" with a resounding "No!", indicating that when a hypothesis is directional, a one-tailed test is required<ref type="foot" target="#foot_2">3</ref> .</s><s>Since one-sided tests are only appropriate whenever null-hypothesis significance tests are appropriate, we have to assume that a null-hypothesis test answers a question a researcher is interested in, and that the null-hypothesis is both plausible and interesting.</s></p><p><s>Beyond this, both in the scientific literature, as in our online discussion, there was general agreement about the need to pre-register one-sided tests.</s><s>For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Marks (1953)</ref> notes: "It must be emphasized that the one-tailed test is not justified unless the prediction is made prior to the data'.</s><s><ref type="bibr">Similarly, Dubey (1991)</ref> recommends: "The choice of the test (one-sided or two-sided) should be specified in the protocol, thereby eliminating any possibilities of post hoc manipulations."</s><s>I will briefly mention some general points that researchers considered in our online discussion about whether one-tailed tests are appropriate<ref type="foot" target="#foot_3">4</ref> .</s><s>One-tailed tests have some clear benefits.</s><s>They require a smaller sample size than a two-tailed test to achieve the same power, while keeping the error rate constant (e.g., at 5%).</s><s>This means that one-tailed tests will often be an optimal choice from an Neyman-Pearson perspective, and this efficiency has an ethical component when funding comes from tax money.</s><s>Another benefit of one-tailed tests is that they are logically consistent with the conclusion we want to draw from studies.</s><s>Researchers typically conclude one mean is larger than another after observing a significant result, while the logically correct conclusion after a significant result in a two-tailed test is that the means differ from zero, but the direction in which they differ has not been tested.</s><s>One-tailed tests also have the statistically attractive property that they have a direct Bayesian interpretation.</s></p><p><s>But there are also downsides.</s><s>A smaller sample size means less precise data (i.e., wider confidence intervals), and less evidence.</s><s>Assuming normally distributed data, the Z value required to reach statistical significance is Z = 1.96 for a two-tailed tests, but only 1.645 for a one-tailed test.</s><s>This means that, even though the Type 1 error rate is the same for one-tailed and two-tailed tests, a lower evidence threshold is passed.</s><s>This bothers neo-Fisherians, who interpret p-values as evidence (e.g., see <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Lombardi &amp; Hurlbert, 2009)</ref>.</s><s>It also means it is slightly easier to find a Type 1 error in the expected direction (e.g., one that confirms one's beliefs).</s><s>Another problem is whether effects in the opposite direction can be described and reported.</s><s>The difference between hypothesis testing and estimation is relevant here -an unexpected effect might not confirm a hypothesis, but the descriptives related to the effect size might still be interesting.</s><s>A final downside of one-tailed tests is that they signal interestedness of a researcher, when disinterestedness might be more desirable.</s></p><p><s>There is almost no work on the acceptance of sequential analyses in psychology.</s></p><p><s>Sequential analyses from a frequentist and Bayesian perspective have been recommended for efficiency gains <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Lakens, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Schonbrodt, Wagenmakers, Zehetleitner, &amp; Perugini, 2015)</ref>, and have been recommended in at least one editorial in psychology (Giner-Sorolla, 2016).</s><s>In essence, controlling alpha levels in sequential analyses is exactly the same as controlling for multiple comparisons as a result of comparing more than 2 conditions, or analyzing multiple dependent variables.</s><s>However, since they lead to lower sample sizes (on average) than non-sequential designs, one can again consider a difference in attitudes between researchers who use a Neyman-Pearson error control approach to statistical inferences, and statistical approaches that more strongly value the amount of evidence in the data.</s><s>However, the amount of evidence one desires and the error rate which is deemed acceptable are too different goals, and require a different approach when designing a study.</s></p><p><s>It is perhaps surprising that no one has ever simply asked researchers whether one-tailed tests and sequential analyses are deemed appropriate.</s><s>Even though statistics is not necessarily a democratic enterprise, science relies on peer review, and thus it is arguably of interest to researchers to know what their peers, and especially those working in editorial boards of top journals in their field, think about how appropriate one-tailed tests are.</s></p><p><s>Furthermore, recent developments, such as the ability to pre-register a study, might have influenced these attitudes.</s><s>Therefore, in Study 1 I asked members of the editorial board of three top journals in psychology to answer seven short questions about the appropriateness of one-tailed tests and sequential analyses.</s><s>Psychology and Personality Science) were manually collected.</s><s>All editors received an e-mail on the 21st of February, 2017, and a reminder on the 28th of February, 2017.</s><s>Respondents were informed that for each completed questionnaire $5 would be donated to a charity that aims to advance science education.</s><s>All data received before the 7th of March, 10:00 am GMT+1 was included in the analysis.</s><s>The questionnaire was administered through SurveyMonkey.</s><s>Overall, 327 emails were sent, of which 235 were opened in an e-mail client, and 87 editors completed the survey of seven questions.</s><s>All anonymized data and materials are available from https://osf.io/pwtrh/.</s></p><p><s>Results.</s><s>The first question asked whether one-tailed tests were ever appropriate in psychology.</s><s>There was no perfect agreement, with 80 editors indicating one-tailed tests were appropriate, and 6 editors who were of the opinion that one-tailed tests are never appropriate in psychology (1 editor indicated not to know whether one-tailed tests were ever appropriate).</s><s>It is interesting to see that there is substantial agreement on this issue, as opposed to the often polarized debate in the literature on this topic.</s><s>Even though around 92% of editors accept one-tailed tests, some editors think the use of one-tailed tests is never appropriate.</s><s>Editorial policies do not explicitly state whether and when one-tailed tests are considered appropriate, but the small diversity in answers suggests it might be useful to specify a general policy on the journal level.</s><s>The mean attitude towards one-tailed tests of editors when one-tailed tests were pre-registered was more positive (M = 5.17, SD = 1.56) than when one-tailed tests were not pre-registered (M = 2.70, SD = 1.43, r = 0.35).</s><s>The difference between measurements (M = 2.47, SD = 1.71) was large, t(86) = 13.47,</s><s>p &lt;

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>General Discussion</head><p><s>Based on the current data, it seems unlikely that the efficiency benefit associated with one-tailed tests and sequential analyses are an efficient way to improve the willingness to pre-register studies.</s><s>There are several reasons why this might be the case.</s><s>First of all, data collection might not be too costly for many researchers, making efficiency benefits trivial.</s></p><p><s>Indeed, if data collection is cheap (e.g., when you perform online studies where participants are paid very little) the difference between 172 participants and 230 participants might not be something you care about.</s><s>As an illustration, one researcher contacted me to say that it was more efficient to simply replicate their own experiment, than to pre-register the study.</s></p><p><s>6 An additional 8 researchers skipped this question.</s><s>Because the default slider position was at 0 but not moving the slider was recorded as a non-response in SurveyMonkey, these researchers might also have desired to answer 0%.</s><s>Another possible reason for the lack of an effect of pointing out the efficiency benefits of pre-registration might be that the perceived benefits of pre-registration are less material, and more idealistic, for most researchers.</s><s>If you value transparency in science, pre-registration is a valuable tool, regardless of the time and money it could potentially save.</s><s>As indicated in the grant proposal for this project, I believe that despite the fact that the hypothesis was falsified by the data, the outcome of the project is relevant.</s><s>The current data at least tentatively suggest immediate individual benefits are not the best way to convince people to pre-register their research, and alternative options (e.g., referring to shared norms) might be a more beneficial approach.</s></p><p><s>Researchers indicated it was rather likely that they would pre-register a study in the next two years, to a substantially greater extent than observed by Watkins ( <ref type="formula">2017</ref>) when asked about their plans in the next six months.</s><s>Whether these self-reported expectations really materialize remain to be seen.</s><s>Another possibility is that the difference between how likely researchers think they are to pre-register a study in the next 2 years, versus the next WILLINGNESS TO PRE-REGISTER 20 six months, is an example of temporal discounting <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Frederick, Loewenstein, &amp; O'Donoghue, 2002)</ref>.</s><s>A follow-up study a few years from now, where the current respondents are asked which percentage of studies they actually pre-registered, could provide an answer to this question.</s></p><p><s>Although we contacted a representative sample of editorial board members and researchers in studies 1 and 2, one limitation of this research is the possibility that self-selection played a role in the people who chose to complete the questionnaire.</s><s>In the editor survey, only one editor indicated not knowing whether one-tailed tests were appropriate in psychology, which is a rather low number compared to the extensive discussion, and sometimes strong disagreement, in the scientific literature.</s><s>Since the invitation to the questionnaire clearly explained the topic was about one-tailed tests and sequential analyses it is possible only editors interested in, and knowledgeable about, this topic filled in the questionnaire.</s><s>We might expect the inclusion of more individuals without clear preferences to reduce the observed effect sizes somewhat, although given the very large effects observed, this does not seem too problematic.</s></p><p><s>In the researcher survey, there is the possibility that the experimental manipulation might have been most effective on researchers without strong opinions about pre-registration, who might have been less interested in filling out this survey.</s><s>Self-selection might have positively biased answers about the perceived benefits and likelihood researchers would pre-register in the future.</s><s>Furthermore, editors and researchers from only three journals were sampled (even though both Psychological Science and JEP:General publish on a wide range of topics in psychology).</s><s>Although the contacted editors are often in editorial boards of other psychology journals, and the same researchers publish in other psychology journals, the selection of journals limits the generalizability of these results.</s></p><p><s>One-tailed tests and sequential analyses might not increase researchers' willingness to preregister their hypotheses, they still yield an important efficiency benefit.</s><s>The ethical arguments to spend research money as efficiently as possible that have been brought to bear WILLINGNESS TO PRE-REGISTER 21 in medicine <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Jennison &amp; Turnbull, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Knottnerus &amp; Bouter, 2001)</ref>, also apply to psychology <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Lakens, 2014)</ref>.</s><s>The results from Study 1 suggest that one-tailed tests and sequential analyses are deemed appropriate by most editors in psychology, and whenever researchers have the goal to determine whether the null-hypothesis can be rejected with a certain maximum error rate, their sample size justification should include a careful cost-benefit analysis, where the consideration of one-tailed tests and/or sequential analyses might be warranted.</s></p><p><s>Even though one-tailed tests and sequential analyses were deemed appropriate by most editors contacted in the current survey (as long as these analyses were pre-registered), communicating this efficiency benefit to researchers was not substantial enough to influence their willingness to pre-register.</s><s>It seems most fruitful to explore other avenues to stimulate the adoption of pre-registration in psychology.</s><s>One possibility is to simply require pre-registration, as is the case in other disciplines such as medicine.</s><s>Although it remains to be seen whether the high self-reported willingness to pre-register will materialize in the future, there seems to a positive trend towards a greater willingness to pre-register studies among psychologists.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head/><label/><figDesc><div><p><s>.
